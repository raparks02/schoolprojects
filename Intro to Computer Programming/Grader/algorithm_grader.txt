Problem:
	Creating a grade calculator that reads in the contents of a text file, calculates the letter grade and score based upon weighted averages, and writes them out to a text file.
	
Input:
	- Text file the computer is going to read in from that includes sections such as Assignments, Participation, Midterms, and Finals along with scores in those sections
	- Name of the text file that the computer will create to output letter grade and score
	
Output:
	- Message telling the person that the entered file is being read and calculated
	- Goodbye message
	- Message if input file can not be opened
	- File created by computer that will output letter grade and score
	
Step-by-Step:
	1. Welcome the player to the grade calculator
	2. Allow the player to input the name of a file that includes categories such as Assignments, Participation, Midterms, and Finals with scores.
	3. Attempt to open the file
		A) If the file can be opened, inform the player of reading the file and calculating grades
			i) Get the lines of the file while not at the end of it through the use of looping and get line functions that stream strings of words
			ii) Use looping to take the value of each score from a weight(category) and find the average of them (add up all scores and divide by the number of scores) 
			iii) Multiply that score by its weight(Participation is 10%, Assignments are 50%, Midterm is 20%, and Final is 20%)
			iv) Continue the loop repeating for the other weights (categories) as the get line function continues until the end of the file is reached
			v) Close the input file stream
			vi) Add up the weighted averages of each category for the final score
			vi) Use a function(calculateLetterGrade) to find letter grade based on final score
				a) If score is greater than or equal to 90, the grade is an A
				b) If score is less than 90 and greater than or equal to 80, the grade is a B
				c) If score is less than 80 and greater than or equal to 70, the grade is a C
				d) If score is less than 70 and greater than or equal to 60, the grade is a D
				e) Any other score is an F
			vii) Allow the player to input the name of a text file
			viii) Inform the player of writing score and letter grade to file
			viii) Create the text file and output the score and letter grade
			ix) Close output file stream
			
		B) If the file can not be opened, inform the player that the file is unable to be opened
	4. Thank the player for using the program
