Problem:
	Creating a program that determines whether an inputted number is prime and prints out the list of prime numbers between 0 and the inputted number through the use of looping, functions, and parameter passing semantics.
	
Input:
	  - Integer input that is determined if prime.
	  - Character input for if the player would like to see the prime numbers between 0 and the inputted number.
	  -Character input for if the player would like to continue to try a different number.
	  
Output:
	- Response telling the player if no primes were found(Example: entered 0 or 1).
	- Response telling the player if entered number is a prime number.
	- Asking the player if they would like to see prime numbers between 0 and inputted number.
	- Displaying prime numbers between 0 and inputted number.
	- Response asking the player if he or she would like to continue.
	- Response telling the player to input a number as long as he or she chooses continue.
	- Goodbye message if the player does not choose to continue.
	
Step-by-Step:
	1. Welcome the player to the prime calculator.
	
	2. Allow the player to input a number.
	
	3. Determine if the entered number is prime through a function(isPrime) that determines if a given number has factors using a for loop.
		a) Display that the number is prime to the player if it is.
		b) Move on if the number has factors and is not prime.
		
	4. Determine how many total prime numbers there are from 0 to the entered number using a function(howManyPrime).
		a)If there are no prime numbers from 0 to entered number(number entered is 0 or 1), display that no prime numbers were found.
		b)If the entered number is 2, display that it is the smallest prime number.
		c)For any other number, display the total amount of prime numbers from 0 to the entered number.
	
	5. If the entered number does have prime numbers from 0 to 100, ask the player if they would like to see the numbers.
		 a) If the player enters the character for yes, use a function(printPrimeNumbers) that loops through each number from 0 to the entered number to test for prime using another function(isPrime).
		 	i) Display these numbers that are prime.
		b) If the player enters the character for no, move on.
	
	6. Allow the player to enter a character input for if he or she would like to continue.
		a) If the player inputs the character for yes, continue the loop by allowing a new number to be entered.
		b) If the player inputs the character for no, thank the player for running the program and terminate.
