Problem: 
	Calculating the area of the following shapes: rectangles, squares, rhombus' and triangles.

Input: 
	Necessary values to calculate area of each shape (length and width for rectangle, side length for square, each diagonal length for rhombus, and base and height for triangle).

Output: 
	The area of the rectangle, square, rhombus, and triangle in that order.

Step-by-Step:
	1. Allow a length and width value of rectangle to be entered
		a. Examine entered length and width values of rectangle
		b. Multiply the length and width values together
		c. Display product as area of rectangle
	2. Allow a side length of square to be entered
		a. Examine entered side length
		b. Square the entered value
		c. Display product as area of square
	3. Allow 2 diagonal values of a rhombus to be entered
		a. Examine entered diagonal values
		b. Multiply the entered diagonal values together
		c. Divide the product calculated by 2
		d. Display calculated value as area of rhombus
	4. Allow a base and height value of triangle to be entered
		a. Examine entered base and height values of triangle
		b. Multiply the base and height values together
		c. Divide the product calculated by 2
		d. Display calculated value as area of triangle
	5. Terminate
